                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/engmariogallo/"target="blank">printing and typesetting</a>
                 industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy 
                 text ever <a href="mailto:prof.eng.mariogallo@gmail.com">since the 1500s</a>, when an unknown printer took a galley
                  of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has 
                  survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                   typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised 
                   in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
                    Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
                     like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
